<p>Parallel Three-Dimensional Fast Fourier Transforms, dubbed P3DFFT, is a library for large-scale computer simulations on parallel platforms. 3D FFT is an important algorithm for simulations in a wide range of fields, including studies of turbulence, climatology, astrophysics and material science. This project was initiated at San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at UC San Diego by its main author Dmitry Pekurovsky, Ph.D. Its continual evolution has resulted in an ever expanding list of features and now includes algorithms beyond FFT (Fast Fourier Transform).  </p>

<p>P3DFFT uses 2D, or pencil, decomposition. This overcomes an important limitation to scalability inherent in FFT libraries implementing 1D (or slab) decomposition: the number of processors/tasks used to run this problem in parallel can be as large as N^2, were N is the linear problem size. This approach has shown good scalability up to O(10^6) cores. </p>

<p>P3DFFT is written in Fortran90/MPI and is optimized for parallel performance. C interface is available, as are detailed documentation and examples in both Fortran and C. A configure script is supplied for ease of installation. This package depends on a serial FFT library such as Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) or IBM's ESSL.</p>

<p>In the forward transform, given an input of an array of 3D real values, an output of 3D complex array of Fourier coefficients is returned. Current features include:</p>

<pre><code>- real-to-complex/complex-to-real FFT in 3D
- real-to-complex FFT in 2D followed by sine/cosine/Chebyshev/empty transform, and the reverse for backward transform.
- pruned transforms (less than full input or output)
- in-place or out-of-place transforms
- multi-variable transforms 
</code></pre>
